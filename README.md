# NanoMonitor

For AMD CPU Nvidia GPU monitoring overlay.

Requires Installing:
- AMD RyzenMaster Monitoring SDK for CPU temp (default install location, will be: `C:\Program Files\AMD\RyzenMasterMonitoringSDK`)

Requires Admin Privileges for CPU temp (fuck you AMD), everything else should work without it.

This is a work in progress.
